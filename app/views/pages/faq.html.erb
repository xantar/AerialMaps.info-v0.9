        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          The ideal way to gather Aerial Imagery is to run in a search grid pattern. Starting at a point, taking a photo, moving <strong>directly forward</strong> taking another photo overlapping the original image 30% to 60% . Continuing this until you reach and endge of the area you wish to map and then moving the drone directly to the side, and then move backwards. Repeating this until you have covered the area.
